Project : Exploring the UK's rice imports and exports

by Aya Tamura, 21 November, 2023

As an Asian living in the United Kingdom, I often eat rice and appreciate the availability of variety of rice. According to the Rice Association, rice is not grown in the UK. I wonder where rice comes from to the UK. Is rice cultivated domestically within the UK, or is it solely imported from abroad? In this project, I aim to conduct research on the locales where rice comes from.
